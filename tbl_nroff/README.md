### Hey y'all

Ive ceased work on these ascii tables because i found an even better web implementation here:

https://ozh.github.io/ascii-tables/

All I will say is that if you have sensitive data you cant always trust what you put into a third party webform.

in that case some of these c implementations my be better for you.
